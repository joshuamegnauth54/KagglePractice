# KagglePractice

In order to practice the dark arts of data I require, well, _data._ Kaggle is a wellspring of data sets spanning a range of topics.

I'd often struggle for hours attempting to find data prior to deciding to delve into Kaggle.

Anywho, the repository above is simply a storage bin for noodling around with data found on Kaggle. The data sets are sourced in the files. I'll work in Python, R, and hopefully [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) by repeating the work across each language.

I also intend for the following repository to act as a portfolio of sorts, unlike my [Miscellaneous](https://github.com/joshuamegnauth54/Miscellaneous) code dump, and thus I'll attempt to maintain some sense of decorum and quality.
